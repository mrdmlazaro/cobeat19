                            The group labeled as Gigachadthis is certified as the official group in which handles the contact tracing program
                    in Manila. This letter serves as proof in order for us to have the permission to get your personal information which consists
                    of your first name, last name, and address.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                            Gigachadthis ensures you that the data they have stored will not be used for spying of any sort. Rest assured, there will be no 
                    data leakage of your said name and address. If that were to happen, you can personally sue Team 4 for their lack of sense of responsibility.

                            The COVID-19 Tracing Program by Team 4 is currently being discretely managed by a group of people.
